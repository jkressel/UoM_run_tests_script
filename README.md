# mkrt
A shell script to create a run-tests script and the .java file(empty) for COMP16121 Java tasks. It's boring af otherwise.

## Prerequisites
A linux box. I have no idea if it'll run on yours. Should do though.

### Installing
Copy the script into ~/bin/

Set to executable

Make sure the bin directory is in your PATH

### Usage

```
mkrt -n NameOfJavaProgram -t 7
```

| Options      | Purpose       | Required  |
| ------------ |:-------------:| ---------:|
| -n    |name of class  | Yes       |
|-t    |number of tests| No       |
|-h     | help | No |
